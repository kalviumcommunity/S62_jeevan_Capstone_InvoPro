# InvoPro - Your Personalised Invoicer

## Project Idea

InvoPro is designed to provide a tailored billing solution for businesses that currently rely on manual invoicing methods. This application addresses the common challenges faced by businesses in managing their billing processes efficiently.

## Problem Statement

Many businesses lack a basic billing application and often resort to using pen and paper for invoicing. This approach not only consumes valuable time but also increases the risk of errors in billing and generating statements. Additionally, some existing applications are native to specific machines, leading to potential data loss and limited accessibility across different devices.

## Technical Analysis

### MongoDB

- **Data Storage**: InvoPro will utilize MongoDB to store billing data, including sales and purchase records.
- **Statement Generation**: The application will facilitate the generation of statements for easy tracking and management.

### Express/Node.js

- **Authentication and Authorization**: The backend will implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect user data.
- **API Endpoints**: Express will provide API endpoints for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, enabling seamless interaction with the database.

### React

- **Interactive User Interface**: The frontend will be built using React, ensuring an interactive and responsive user experience.
- **Ease of Use**: The application will be designed to be user-friendly, allowing users to navigate effortlessly.
- **Customizable**: Users will have the ability to customize their invoicing experience according to their specific needs.

## Day-by-Day Plan

- **12-02-2025**: Complete the Low-Fidelity Design (LoFiD).
- **13-02-2025**: Work on the High-Fidelity Design (HiFiD).
